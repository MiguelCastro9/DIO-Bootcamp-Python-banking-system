# Overview

Create a banking system with operations: withdraw, deposit and view statements.


### Challenge

We were hired by a large bank to develop their new system. This bank wants to modernize its operations and for this I chose the Python language. 
For the first version of the system we must implement only 3 operations: deposit, withdrawal and statement.

### Deposit Operation

It must be possible to deposit positive amounts into my bank account. v1 of the project only works with 1 user, so we don't need to worry about identifying the branch and 
bank account number. All deposits must be stored in a variable and displayed in the statement operation.

### Withdrawal Operation

The system must allow you to make 3 daily withdrawals with a maximum limit of R$500.00 per withdrawal. 
If the user does not have a balance in their account, the system must display a message stating that it will not be possible to withdraw the money due to lack of balance. 
All withdrawals must be stored in a variable and displayed in the statement operation.


### Extract Operation

This operation must list all deposits and withdrawals made to the account. At the end of the list, the current account balance should be displayed. 
If the statement is blank, display the message: No transactions were carried out. The values must be displayed using the format R$ xxx.xx, example: 1500.45 = R$ 1500.45
